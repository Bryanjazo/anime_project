# greet the user
# I want the program to then have an interface where theyre able to input the genre they like in anime..
# then were gonna either have them type so we can error check in order for them to type the corrrect thing and not type outside of the scope
# then what were gonna do is then have a option picker where they dont type but pick
# after they pick the genre were going to have it pick a more detailed description of their genre and base it towards what they like
